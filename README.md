In this project we do Sentence Classification from Scratch 

The full process will require the following steps:
1. Understand the task specification
2. Collect raw data
3. Annotate test and training data for development
4. Train and test models using this data
5. Deploy the model

I've used bert-base-uncased ,bert-base-multilingual-cased models.
